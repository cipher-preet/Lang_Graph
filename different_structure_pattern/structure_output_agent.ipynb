    "# A Structured Output Agent in LangChain (or other LLM frameworks) refers to an agent that produces responses in a specific structured format, such as JSON, dictionaries, or other structured data types. These agents are particularly useful when you want to ensure that your responses conform to a defined schema, making it easier to parse, validate, and utilize in downstream applications.\n",
